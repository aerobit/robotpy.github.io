IRC

During the FRC Build Season, some RobotPy developers may be able to be reached on **#robotpy** channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml). _Note: the channel is not very active, but if you stick around long enough someone will probably answer your question -- think in terms of email response time_
